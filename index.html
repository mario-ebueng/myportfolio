            <p>Hello world! Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mario Ebueng and I am 30 years old currently living in the city of Las Vegas, NV. I was born and raised in Hawaii and I moved to Vegas in 2018.
                I currently work as a dialysis technician and I have about 10 years experience in the medical field. I'm ecstatic about switching gears to a new career in software engineering!
                I've always found excitement in how websites are developed, so I feel that this course at coding temple will be a great starting point for me. As my portfolio and skills grow,
                I believe this page will definitely evolve and/or change, so please stick with me throughout the process and I'll be sure to keep you entertained!</p>

            <p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and my family. I also like playing and listening to music. I can play a lot of different instruments and I sing a little.
                The different types of instruments I can play are guitar, bass, piano, and drums. When I feel like relaxing or staying home, I tend to binge watch a lot of anime and different
                types of tv shows. And when I'm in the mood, I do also enjoy cooking. But I feel like my favorite thing to do in the world is travel, especially with my girlfriend. We often take
                trips back home to Hawaii and we plan on traveling all over the world one day!</p>

        <article id="about-aiya">
            <p>I have a dog and her name is Aiya. She is a 10 month old, cream-colored, Shiba Inu. She is the cutest, goodest, and craziest dog in the whole world.
                Although she drives me crazy (a lot), she has definitely made a huge difference in my life. She's taught me to be more patient, understanding, and responsible.
                Aiya loves going for long walks, playing with other dogs and humans, and most of all treats. She's stubborn, chews up everything she deems as a toy, and she does not know how to keep still.
                But I wouldn't trade her for anything in the world!</p>
